1. Copy _cdd to a directory like /usr/local/bin or ~/bin

2. Add the following to ~/.bashrc as an example.  The example assumes path /usr/local/bin/_cdd.

    if [[ -x /usr/local/bin/_cdd ]]
    then
        function cdd { while read x; do eval $x >/dev/null; done < <(dirs -l -p | /usr/local/bin/_cdd "$@"); }
        alias cd=cdd
    fi
